        <p>Addiction is a chronic brain disorder characterized by compulsive substance use or behavior despite harmful consequences. It involves intense cravings, loss of control, tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, and continued use despite negative impacts on physical health, mental well-being, relationships, finances, and legal status. Addictions can encompass substances like drugs and alcohol, as well as behaviors such as gambling, gaming, or overeating. Treatment often includes therapy, counseling, medications (for certain substance addictions), and support from loved ones to help individuals break free from the cycle of addiction and mitigate its detrimental effects on their life. Early intervention is crucial for a better chance of recovery and reducing harm.</p>
